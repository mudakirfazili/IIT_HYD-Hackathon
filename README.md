# Introduction

SRAM's are the type of random access memories. They store information in the form of static latch (cross-coupled inverters). They dont require periodic refresh and have short access delays and low power consumption. Due to these properties they are a better contedor for cache memories inside the processors and microcontrollers. They are usually present in various system in sizes ranging from several KBs to a few MBs'.

## Problem Statement

Development and analysis of a 10T SRAM cell on 28nm fabrication technology using Synopsys Custom Compiler.
- Plot the various signal to noise margins.
- Determine the access time.
- Calculate the area estimates.

# Basics of SRAM
